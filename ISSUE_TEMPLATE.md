# Week 7: Git Challenge

Welcome to week 7 of software training! This week, you'll be completing a series of `git` and GitHub challenges. **To get started, click the "Submit new issue" at the bottom of this page!** From there, work through the rest of this checklist.

If you need any help, we recommend these online resources:

You can, of course, also flag down an instructor if you run into anything.

## Your objectives
- [ ] Star this repository
- [ ] Make a personal copy of the repo that will live on your GitHub account. This allows you to freely make changes to the project without affecting the original. Your copy will remain associated with the original, allowing you to submit a pull request to the original author.
- [ ] Make a copy of that repository that lives on your computer instead of on a github server somewhere. Don’t forget, this version of the repo is connected to the remote version so that changes can be synced between the two.
- [ ] Set your forked repository as a remote named origin
- [ ] Set our repository as a remote named rj
- [ ] Create a new parallel version of the repository named your gt username (ex. gburdell3)
- [ ] Use the terminal to create a folder named “2017” in the root of the repo
- [ ] Use the terminal to create an empty text file named yourgtusername.txt in the 2017 folder
- [ ] Stage/commit the file (make sure you leave good commit messages)
- [ ] Create a new branch named gtusername/add-text
- [ ] Add some ASCII art to your file (no longer than 30 lines) on that branch and merge it into the gtusername branch
- [ ] Make a merge conflict happen between yourgtusername and a branch named yourgtusername/merge-conflict. Then, resolve it
- [ ] Create two branches named b1 and b2
- [ ] Commit a file called stuff1.txt in b1
- [ ] Commit a file called stuff2.txt in b2
- [ ] Take the changes from b1 and apply them to b2
- [ ] In b2, delete both files and commit the changes
- [ ] Take the changes from b2 and apply them to b1
- [ ] Take the changes from b1 and apply them to yourgtusername (this should not cause a merge conflict)
- [ ] Delete all local branches not named master or yourgtusername
- [ ] Send your committed changes to your fork’s gtusername remote branch
- [ ] Create a pull request from your fork’s gtusername branch to our master branch and request one of us for review (if you try to merge it you won’t be able to because permissions)
